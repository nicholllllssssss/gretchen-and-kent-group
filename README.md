Overview
This performance task aimed to enhance our understanding and application of object-oriented programming (OOP) by creating and using classes and objects. Through the activities, we focused on designing two classes, `Product` and `Movie`, and implementing methods to manage and retrieve their properties. This report provides a detailed explanation of the development process, challenges encountered, and key lessons learned.



Development Process

Activity 1: Product
1. Defining the Class
   We started by creating the `Product` class, which included five essential properties: `productName`, `price`, `category`, `quantity`, and `brand`. These properties represent key details about any product.

2. Implementing Methods 
   - `setProduct` Method: This method was designed to accept multiple parameters and assign their values to the corresponding properties of the class.
   - `getProductInfo` Method: This method was created to return a string containing all product details in a well-formatted manner.

3. Creating and Using the Object 
   We instantiated an object of the `Product` class. Using the `setProduct` method, we assigned values to the product’s properties, and then called the `getProductInfo` method to display the details of the product.

Activity 2: Movie
1. Defining the Class 
   The `Movie` class was structured similarly, with five important properties: `title`, `genre`, `director`, `releaseYear`, and `rating`. These properties describe the key details of a movie.

2. Implementing Methods  
   - **`setMovie` Method**: This method allowed us to set the values for the movie’s properties using parameters.
   - **`getMovieInfo` Method**: This method returned the movie’s details as a formatted string.

3. Creating and Using the Object  
   An object of the `Movie` class was created. We used the `setMovie` method to assign values to the movie’s properties, and the `getMovieInfo` method to retrieve and display the information.

Challenges Encountered
1. Naming and Property Consistency 
   One challenge was ensuring consistent naming for the properties and methods, as small errors in naming caused issues during runtime.

2. Formatting the Output  
   Another challenge was ensuring the output string was well-structured and readable. It took a few attempts to align the format with the requirements.

3. Debugging Errors 
   Debugging errors, such as incorrect assignments or missed method calls, required careful analysis and step-by-step testing to resolve.

Insights and Learning
This activity allowed us to better understand the structure and functionality of classes, objects, and methods in OOP. It emphasized the importance of organizing code logically and ensuring proper syntax. Debugging errors and refining the output were valuable experiences that improved our problem-solving skills. Overall, this task demonstrated how OOP principles are applied in real-world scenarios, enhancing both our technical skills and confidence in programming.

Conclusion
Completing this performance task successfully demonstrated our ability to define and work with classes and objects. Despite encountering challenges, the process was rewarding and provided a deeper understanding of OOP concepts. This hands-on experience was crucial in preparing us for more complex programming tasks in the future.
